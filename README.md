# Leisure
Leisure, also refered to as "LeisureBot" is a game bot hosted and maintained by `@vicr123#5096` and `@zBlake#6715`. It allows users to submit their own games (in a specific format), and have them hosted on the bot for other people to play. Although not available yet, we will soon introduce an API with which to upload your games to, and then after we approve your game and make sure it's in a suitable format, users will then be able to play your game on Leisure!

#### Please note that Leisure is in an extremely early alpha. Features ARE intended to change quite often, and things said here now may not reflect what happens in the future.

Leisure is not public as of now, but here are some of the features you can expect to see from it;
* A game loader that allows as many users as you'd like to join
* A fully functional API to allow users to submit their own games to Leisure so other people can play
* A wide variety of games to pick from and play, one great example being FFC (Final Fantastic Card), a spin-off of the popular game UNO, now playable on Discord with Leisure.

Please check back here in the future to learn more information!
